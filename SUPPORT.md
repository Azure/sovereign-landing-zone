# Support 

## SLZ support scope 

Customers who request support for design guidance or development assistance may be directed to file a GitHub issue. Customers may also have to work with our Microsoft solution architects, Microsoft partners or software vendors directly for scenarios that aren't supported by the Microsoft customer support team. Examples include, but aren't limited to: 

* Application development 
* Cloud deployment architecture 
* Troubleshooting custom applications 
* Custom code 

The following are some of the scenarios that the Microsoft support team will assist with: 

* Issues that occur during installation or configuration 
* Deployment errors that occur when customers try to deploy applications to the Azure platform and services 
* Runtime errors that occur when customers use the Azure platform and services 
* Performance issues that affect applications that were built by using the supported open-source technologies on the Azure platform and services 

Any issues that are deemed outside of the above list by Microsoft support and/or requires bugfix in the Template or Code in the repo, Microsoft support will redirect user to file the issue on GitHub or to contact their Microsoft solution architect or representative (when applicable).
