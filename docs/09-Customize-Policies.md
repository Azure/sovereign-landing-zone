# Customize and configure policies

A default installation of the SLZ will come with the Sovereignty Baseline policy initiatives deployed with a `Deny` effect and all the ALZ Policies assigned. However, it is common for organizations to customize and configure policies further to meet their governance requirements. Details on how to achieve this can be found in one of the following areas:

1. Review the [Sovereignty Baseline policy initiatives](scenarios/Sovereignty-Baseline-Policy-Initiatives.md) page for more details about configuring the baseline.
2. Review the [ALZ Policies](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/ALZ-Policies) page and links within that page for more details about policy governance within the landing zone, and review the [Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark](https://aka.ms/azsecbm) documentation for details about best security practices.
    * The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark are part of the ALZ Policy initiatives.
3. Review the [Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty policy portfolio](scenarios/Using-Policy-Portfolio.md) page for more details about using one of the initiatives within the portfolio or how any built-in policy initiatives can be used.
4. Review the [Custom Policies](scenarios/Custom-Policies.md) page for more details about deploying other organization-specific custom policies.
