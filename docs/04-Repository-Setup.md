The version of the SLZ being used can be determined from the [git tag](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) or the [release version](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) the clone or fork was made from.

### Option 2

If you do not plan on contributing or do not intend to receive updates, you can simply download a copy of the [repository](https://github.com/Azure/sovereign-landing-zone) to your local machine, and unzip.
